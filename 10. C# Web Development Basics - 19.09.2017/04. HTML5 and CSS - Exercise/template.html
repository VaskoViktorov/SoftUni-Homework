<p>Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink in
    the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water 
    and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains â€” most commonly from 
    malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used.
    uring the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the
     wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer.
      Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and
       other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing 
       agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits
        may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing,
         the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing 
         and replaced with forced carbonation.</p>
